As part of my community involvement, I have decided to devote my time into working on, updating and completing the website for CoderDojo Portarlington. This group holds a special place in my heart as it is where I learnt to program, which has directly influenced my professional life today. As such, I wanted to give back and provide an easy-to-access portal for mentors, students and parents alike to know everything there is about the club, such as the courses taught, events being hosted, availabilities and much more. To complete this, I have designed a week-by-week plan of what is to be done to complete this website. The verification for these activities will come from both the champion of this CoderDojo (Mark Gavin), and proof of dates for updates will be done via screenshots of code commits.
