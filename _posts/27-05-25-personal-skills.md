For my personal skill, I have decided to learn the Italian language. The purpose for this is several-fold. Firstly, given I am working in Rome, Italy for a six-month research placement it would be important for me to understand more advanced conversations that I'd need to be involved in. Also, my partner speaks Italian and I believe that learning it would be really nice. Finally, I have developed a love for learning languages in terms of linguistics and as a challenge I have had trouble with before. I have tried on several occasions to teach myself a language from scratch and often failed. However, with both the immersive environment and the guided classes by the Expats in Rome, I believe that this time I have a real shot of getting to B1 with this language.
